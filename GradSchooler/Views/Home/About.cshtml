        Jessica and Isiah are two students from the Pacific Northwest studying Computer Science.<br/><br/>
        GradSchooler is their senior symposium capstone project. They were inspired to make the web app
        because of how difficult it was during their research and application process to find
        consolodated and accessible information about graduate schools on the internet.
